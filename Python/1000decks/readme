PURPOSE
----------------------

Program will simulate playing the War card game and approximate the average number of hands per game by running the game multiple times.


A standard 52-card deck is shuffled and dealt to two players so each receives 26 cards into their personal decks. 
Then hands are played until the one player runs out of cards. If the other player still has cards, they win, otherwise the game is a draw.

A hand consists of the following steps:

Both players simultaneously reveal the top card from their respective decks placing them into a common pool.
When those cards are revealed the face value, ignoring the suit, is compared. If one is higher than the other, 
the player with the higher cards takes all of the cards in the common pool and places them on the bottom of their personal decks, ending the turn.
If the face value of the cards is the same, then place the top card from both player decks into the common pool, 
then reveal another card for comparison. The process of moving the top cards to the common pool followed by another card reveal 
continues until either there is a winner of the war or one player runs out of cards.
The game ends when one player runs out of cards. If both players run out of cards simultaneously, the game is a draw, 
otherwise the player that still has cards is the victor.
