The purpose of this program is to take a dictionary list of words, do an MD5 hash on them
and compare them to a file of hashes, cracking the hashed password and printing the time it took in seconds.
Two sample files are included:

dict.txt -- 10000 of the most common passwords
sample_hashes.txt - 5 sample MD5 hashes to crack


---------------------
Running the program
---------------------

python3 dictionary_crack.py
