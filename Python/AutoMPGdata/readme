Purpose
---------------------
This program will download a publicly available data set and develop some classes that
will be useful in working with the data. The data set contains information about fuel efficiency
for some different automobiles.
This data set consists of 398 records each having nine attributes. 

The data will be downloaded and  saveed in a file called auto-mpg.data.txt. 
The links below describe the AutoMPG data set that is part of the UCI Machine
Learning Repository.
