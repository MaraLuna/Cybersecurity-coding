Design Decisions 
-------------------------
 The program will automatically prompt the user for their name and the rooms they would like to join
 and will connect to the server and port specified when running the program.
    User's names are limited to 60 bytes.

 Then the user will be prompted with a message and asked for which room/user the message is for 
 and will send that to the server.
    Rooms are limited in size to less than 60 bytes.

 The program will also be monitoring for incoming server messages.

To send a message to a room, type a message when promoted and then enter the room to send the message to.
    Messages are limited in size to 3800 bytes.

 To send a direct message to another user, simply type the message and then when prompted - enter the user's name.
    Messages are limited in size to 3800 bytes.

 To disconnect at any time type 'exit' when prompted for a message to send.


-------------------------
Possible Issues
-------------------------

Users may encounter an issue where when trying to send a message, a server message is received and printed on the screen.

Multiple users with the same name are not validated.
